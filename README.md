<h1 align="center">BOOK SEARCH ENGINE üëã</h1>

## Description

*Book Search Engine is an application that allows the users to search for their desired books using Googlr publicly available API. The application uses MERN stack and it is connected by Apollo Server and Apollo Provider node packages. In this application the user has the option to signup, login and search for the books and there has the option to save the books, retrieve the saved books and also delete the books. Without login to the application, the user also has the option to search for the book, but at that time he/she will not have the option to save the books. This is a very updated and timely software.*
